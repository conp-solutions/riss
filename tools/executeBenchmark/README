2) enter the new directory

3) add all necessary files to "files.txt"

4) set the memory and time limit in "overview.dat"

5) copy the binary into the directory "bin"

6) adapt the name of the binary in "start.sh"

7) start the experiment with "./start.sh"

8) collect evaluation data with "./fastEva.sh"



How to analyze the output for single file

1) get the hashcode for the run with
   "./hashFile.sh <file.cnf>"

2) open the output file in the directory "tmp"
   (.err for stderr, .out for stdout, .runlim for environment)
