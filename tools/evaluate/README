Before getting started

1) adapt the script download.sh so that the correct data.csv files are copied here



How to evaluate the data of a benchmark
(the columnnames in the plots, as well as the limits for the axis might be adopted)

1) copy the data into an extra directory with "./download.sh <experimentName>"

2) enter the (new) directory

3) copy all scripts here "cp ../scripts/*.sh ."

4) normalize the solver files (checks status and exit code, might not work for simplification only)
   with "./normalize.sh"

5) compare the solutions wrt their exit codes with "./joinAndCheckSAT.sh sat.dat *.csv"

6) show a summary table with "./summarize.sh sat.dat"

7) draw plot with run time "./plotAllCactus.sh time 4 *.csv" that produces a file time.pdf

8) more usueful plots: scatter plot ./plotXYfiles.sh

9) a nicer table: "./joinTimes.sh times.dat *.csv" and "./summarizeTimes.sh times.dat <timeout>"
