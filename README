BUILDING: 

Usually, when a tool has been build and another tool should be build as well, then
the next build call can be executed. However, some tool require additional build 
flags, so that an intermediate "make clean" should be executed. This holds especially
when building Pcasso.

To build Riss (by default without constructing DRAT-proofs):
make rissRS

With producing DRAT proofs:
make rissRS ARGS="DRATPROOF"

To build Coprocessor:
make coprocessorRS

To build Qprocessor:
make qprocessorRS

To build Mprocessor:
make mprocessorRS

To build Priss:
make prissRS

To build Pcasso:
make pcassoRS

To build ShiftBMC (by default without ABC library):
make shiftbmcs

To build ShiftBMC with ABC library:
make shiftbmc-abcs


To get help, run
<tool> --help
