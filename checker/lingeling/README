These are the sources of the SAT solver Lingeling.  To compile issue
'./configure && make'.  This will build the library 'liblgl.o', the
sequential solver 'lingeling', its parallel version 'plingeling',
and the cube & conquer back-end 'ilingeling'.

It will also build an MUS extractor 'museling', and a bounded model checker
'blimc'.  The later will only be built if you compiled a copy of the AIGER
library from 'http://fmv.jku.at/aiger' in '../aiger/'.

The file VERSION contains the current version number.
